# ML Workbench

This repository contains a collection of machine learning algorithms which I think every Machine Learning engineer should be familiar with.

Following Quora question was the motivation for me to work on this repository. 
(What are the top 10 data mining or machine learning algorithms?)[https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-top-10-data-mining-or-machine-learning-algorithms]

Presently, repository contests of following algorithms.

1. Linear Regression
2. Logistic Regression
